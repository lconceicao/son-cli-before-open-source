# son-cli
SONATA SDK command line interface tools

This set of command line tools are meant to aid the SONATA service developers on their tasks. The tools are briefly described as follows.
- `son-workspace` creates, configures and manages development workspaces and projects.
- `son-publish` allows the publication of projects, services and functions to private catalogues.
- `son-package` packages a project, containing services and functions, to be instantiated in the SONATA Service Platform. All project components are syntatically validated and external dependencies are retrieved to produce a complete service package.
- `son-push` is used to upload the service package to the Service Platform Gatekeeper.
- `son-monitor` provides tools to easily monitor/generate metrics for debugging and analyzing service performance.
    

## Building
To build the son-cli tools it is recommended the use of a virtual environment to avoid polluting your system and to offer isolation from the installed libraries on the host.

Prerequisites:
- python 3 (3.4 used for most of the development)
- virtualenv
- docker (used by son-monitor)
- docker-compose (used by son-monitor)

### Creating a virtualenv:
1. Install virtualenvwrapper using your distribution repositories or the pip package.
https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
1. Create a virtualenv for this project 
`mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python34 sonata`

### Clone and build the project
activate the virtualenv for the project `workon sonata` then clone the project and bootstrap and run buildout. This will download all the dependencies and creante the development environment.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:sonata-nfv/son-cli.git 
cd son-cli
python bootstrap.py
bin/buildout
```

If you are using pycharm, the IDE has support both for buildout and for virtualenvs,
please read their fine documentation on the subject before proceeding.

### Generated binaries
The buildout generates the binaries for the tools `son-workspace`, `son-publish`, `son-package`, `son-push` and `son-monitor`. Information on how to use the tools is detailed in Usage section bellow.

    ```

## Usage
The usage guidelines of the son-cli tools are described as follows.

### son-workspace

Create workspaces and projects

This tool is responsible to create workspaces and generate project layouts.

```sh
usage: son-workspace [-h] [--init] [--workspace WORKSPACE] [--project PROJECT]
                     [--debug]

Generate new sonata workspaces and project layouts

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  
  --init                Create a new sonata workspace
  
  --workspace WORKSPACE
                        location of existing (or new) workspace. If not
                        specified will assume '$HOME/.son-workspace'
                        
  --project PROJECT     create a new project at the specified location
  
  --debug               increases logging level to debug
```

Example on how to create an workspace and a project:

```sh
	son-workspace --init --workspace /home/user/workspaces/ws1
	son-workspace --workspace /home/user/workspace/ws1 --project /home/user/workspace/ws1/projects/p1
```

This example creates the workspace 'ws1' and a project 'p1' associated with it.

### son-publish
This tool publishes service descriptors, function descriptors to a catalogue. It is possible to publish all the components of a project using the `--project` option, instead of publishing a single component. Before any descriptor is published, a syntax validation is performed against the latest schemas, defined in the son-schema repository (https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-schema/tree/master/package-descriptor).

```sh
usage: son-publish [-h] [--workspace WORKSPACE] [--project PROJECT]
                   [-d COMPONENT] [-c CATALOGUE]

Publish a project or component to the catalogue server

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  
  --workspace WORKSPACE
                        Specify workspace. Default is located at
                        '/home/lconceicao/.son-workspace'
                        
  --project PROJECT     Specify project to be published
  
  -d COMPONENT, --component COMPONENT
                        Project component to be published.
                        
  -c CATALOGUE, --catalogue CATALOGUE
                        Catalogue ID where to publish. Overrides defaults in
                        workspace config.
```

Example on how to publish a single descriptor:
```sh
    son-publish --workspace /home/user/workspaces/ws1 --component vnfd-firewall.yml
```

Example on how to publish all the descriptors of a project:
```sh
    son-publish --workspace /home/user/workspace/ws1 --project /home/user/project/prj1
```
These examples assume that the catalogue server address is defined at the workspace configuration.
Otherwise, the catalogue address must be specified explicitly.


### son-package
Generate a SONATA SDK package.

This tool delivers a SON file compiling all the required descriptors of specified the project and workspace.

The generated file structure follows the format defined in the package-descriptor of the son-schema repository (https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-schema/tree/master/package-descriptor). Please check folder examples for a demo package.

```sh
usage: son-package [-h] [--workspace WORKSPACE] [--project PROJECT]
                   [-d DESTINATION] [-n NAME]

Generate new sonata package

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --workspace WORKSPACE
                        Specify workspace to generate the package. If not
                        specified will assume '$HOME/.son-workspace'

  --project PROJECT     create a new package based on the project at the
                        specified location. If not specified will assume the
                        current directory.

  -d DESTINATION, --destination DESTINATION
                        create the package on the specified location

  -n NAME, --name NAME  create the package with the specific name
```

son-package will create a package inside the DESTINATION directory. If DESTINATION is not specified, the package will be deployed at <project root/target>.

Example on how to package a project:
```sh
    son-package --workspace /home/user/workspace/ws1 --project /home/user/project/prj1
```
Example on how to package a project with custom destination and package name:
```sh
    son-package --workspace /home/user/workspace/ws1 --project /home/user/project/prj1 --d /home/user/packages -n sonata-demo.son
```


### son-push
Upload a SONATA SDK package to the Gatekeeper for instantiation. With this tools it is also possible to list the packages uploaded and deployed at the Platform.

```sh
usage: son-push [-h] [-P] [-I] [-U UPLOAD_PACKAGE] [-D DEPLOY_PACKAGE_UUID]
                platform_url

Push packages to the SONATA service platform/emulator or list
packages/instances available on the SONATA platform/emulator.
    
positional arguments:
  platform_url          url of the gatekeeper/platform/emulator

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  
  -P, --list_packages   List packages uploaded to the platform
  
  -I, --list_instances  List deployed packages on the platform
  
  -U UPLOAD_PACKAGE, --upload_package UPLOAD_PACKAGE
                        Filename incl. path of package to be uploaded
                        
  -D DEPLOY_PACKAGE_UUID, --deploy_package_uuid DEPLOY_PACKAGE_UUID
                        UUID of package to be deployed (must be available at
                        platform)

Example usage:
    son-push http://127.0.0.1:5000 -U sonata-demo.son
    son-push http://127.0.0.1:5000 --list-packages
    son-push http://127.0.0.1:5000 --deploy-package <uuid>
    son-push http://127.0.0.1:5000 -I

```

### son-monitor

```

This command starts all the related docker files (cAdvisor, Prometheus DB, PushGateway and son-emu (experimental))
```
son-monitor init
```

After a service has been deployed on the SDK emulator (son-emu), son-monitor can be used.
Son-monitor uses the son-emu rest api and Prometheus.

*Example1*: Expose the tx_packets metric from son-emu network switch-port where vnf1 (default 1st interface) is connected.
The metric is exposed to the Prometheus DB.
```
son-monitor son-monitor interface start -vnf vnf1 -me tx_packets
```

*Example2*: Install a flow_entry in son-emu, monitor the tx_bytes on that flow_entry.
The metric is exposed to the Prometheus DB.
```
son-monitor flow_total start -src vnf1  -dst vnf2  -ma "dl_type=0x0800,nw_proto=17,udp_dst=5001"  -b -c 11 -me tx_bytes
```

*Example3*:  Send a query to the prometheus DB to retrieve the earlier exposed metrics, or default metric exposed by cAdvisor.
The Prometheus query language can be used.
```
son-monitor query --vim emu -d datacenter1 -vnf vnf1 -q 'sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{id="/docker/<uuid>"}[10s]))'
```
